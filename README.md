# MaxFlow 
Before running this program, make sure you have python3 installed on your machine, as well as the networkx and pygraphviz packages. 
To run the program use the command: 
`python3 main.py`  
This will generate 10 graphs and solutions by default.  
To change that number, use the flag
`--ngraphs=i` where `i` is the number of graphs you would like to generate.
